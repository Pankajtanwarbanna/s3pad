# S3pad - Edit S3 Files Directly in Terminal

S3pad is a tiny command-line tool written in JavaScript that allows you to edit file directly from Amazon S3 without leaving your terminal. It leverages the power of the Vim editor for file editing and provides a seamless workflow for handling S3 files.

> At work, we manage product configuration files on S3. Each time a configuration change is needed, it requires delving into the AWS jungleâ€”logging in, navigating through S3, downloading the file, making edits, and then re-uploading the configuration file. This process is tedious and unnecessary, so I developed a small tool for swift edits directly without leaving my cozy command line. 

## Installation

1. **Clone the repository:**

```
git clone https://github.com/Pankajtanwarbanna/s3pad.git
```

2. **Navigate to the project directory**

```
git clone https://github.com/Pankajtanwarbanna/s3pad.git
```

3. **Install dependencies**

```
npm install
```

4. **Create a symbolic link to make the command globally accessible**

```
npm link
```

## Requirements
Vim installation on your system is recommended for better handling, but other vi editors can also be used. Along with this, node and npm is also required.

## How to Run

1. Run the command with a valid S3 path:

```
s3pad s3://<bucket-name>/<path-to-file>
```

2. Follow the on-screen instructions for editing the file in Vim.

3. Save and close the editor.

4. The file will be uploaded back to the specified S3 path.

## Note
Ensure that AWS credentials are configured on your system or set up the necessary environment variables for authentication.

Feel free to contribute and enhance the functionality of S3pad! If you encounter any issues or have suggestions, please open an issue on the GitHub repository.
